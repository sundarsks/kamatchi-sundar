	<h1> OVERVIEW  </h2>
		<p> A super sports car soul and the functionality typical for an SUV: this is Lamborghini Urus, the world’s first Super Sport Utility Vehicle. Identifiable as an authentic Lamborghini with its unmistakable DNA, Urus is at the same time a groundbreaking car: the extreme proportions, the pure Lamborghini design and the outstanding performance make it absolutely unique. Urus’ distinctive silhouette with a dynamic flying coupé line shows its super sports origins, while its outstanding proportions convey strength, solidity and safety. Without a doubt the factors at the heart of Urus’ success are advanced design, extraordinary driving dynamics and thrilling performance. All these features allowed Lamborghini to launch a Super Sport Utility Vehicle remaining loyal to its DNA.
			Urus conveys its utmost versatility also in its design, which meets the requirements of a wide variety of customers with Style packages, exterior details in carbon fiber or the Off-Road package. </p>
			<h1> EMOTION  </h2>
	     	A distinct Lamborghini engine sound, coupled with traits of a sports car and SUV, provide the driver with a uniquely emotional experience. With its strong personality, pure design and absolute sportiness, Lamborghini Urus is one of a kind. The world’s first Super Sport Utility Vehicle is easy, safe and fun to drive, thanks to its ANIMA (Adaptive Network Intelligent MAnagement) Selector that delivers pure driving emotions and new specific settings for the best driving dynamics. Urus is a versatile car perfectly suited for everyday driving, but it also provides the distinct engine sound, all of the thrill and the high performance of a real Lamborghini. </p>
			
<h1>			EXTERIOR DESIGN </h1>
<p> Lamborghini Urus has a cutting-edge, distinct and streamlined design with multiple souls: sporty, elegant and off-road. Its muscular surfaces make it appear strong and self-secure, while the mixed tires allow a luxury super sports car look. All the surfaces are designed with a clear attention to functionality. Some Lamborghini details and iconic shapes can be immediately recognized at first glance, such as the “Y” and the hexagon elements, the front bonnet with center peak and the cross lines on rear door. The extreme proportions and the single silhouette line make Urus a real Lamborghini. Furthermore, its proportions are unique since it is the lowest SUV  in its class. Urus design took inspiration from the heritage of the LM002 in regard to the power dome showing the position of the engine and the significant diagonal lines, while the frameless doors recall the iconic Marcello Gandini line.</p>

<h1> INTERIOR </h1>
<p> In the Lamborghini Urus interior, luxurious Italian craftsmanship meets state-of-the-art technology. The aeronautic design and the driver-oriented instrument concept with three TFT screens (one for the instruments, one for infotainment and one for comfort functions, including virtual keyboard feature with hand-writing recognition) put the driver’s needs at the forefront and make the overall experience more comfortable and enjoyable. The dashboard architecture follows the “Y” theme inspired by iconic Lamborghini models. The interior can be customized, starting from the five-seater architecture with bench seat, or four seats with two individual back seats, and be made even more elegant or sportier, through the selection of different kinds of colors and materials, such as: natural leather, Alcantara®, wood finish, aluminum or carbon – with the option for further sophistication on select materials through contrast stitching or Q-citura. Urus features the largest range of options ever presented on a Lamborghini , with multiple souls converging to create a unique vehicle. Furthermore, Lamborghini Urus is the first five-seater super sports car.</p>
